    description: |-
      You approach the blue cat and it nuzzles up to you, its interlocking plates of chitin brushing against your leg.
      It seems to emanate a soft light. You inspect its collar...

    description: |-
      Strangely enough the hallway goes on for a while until reaching another wall.

      There is nothing in this hallway. It might aswell have been called a hole.

      There is a dining hall to the south.
    fardescription: You open the door and find a winding hallway. You close the door.

    name: Library
    description: |-
      You can't actually see the ceiling in this monster of a room, with its walls that creep up into poorly-lit heights and bookshelves that do the same, unhindered, full of books, spiderwebs, parchment.
      There are several tables and chairs strewn about, and writing implements. More parchment.
      The bookshelves are spaced far apart, probably to grant more space to whatever studious denizens filled the room before you came here.

      There is a dining hall east of here.
    fardescription: It looks like a library.

    name: Kitchen
    description: |-
      You enter the kitchen, and immediately you recognize the sickeningly sweet smell of peach jam. There is a large clay pot here filled with the stuff.
      Other than that, it looks like a pretty normal gourmet kitchen, stocked with pots, pans, knives, and of course unprepared food. Save for the pot of jam.
      There's also a cat here! It seems to glisten in the light, oddly.

      There is a dining hall north of here.
    fardescription: There is a kitchen here. A sweet smell emanates from it.
